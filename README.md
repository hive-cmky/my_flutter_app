Version v1
-----------
I've created a clean, minimal Flutter form for the Resident Certificate application that works on both Android and iOS. Here are the key features:
Design Highlights:

Clean, minimal design with subtle colors
Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
Blue color scheme matching the original
Required fields marked with red asterisk (*)
Form validation for required fields

Features Included:

All form fields from the screenshot
Photo upload section with placeholder (functionality to be added later)
Dropdown menus for Salutation, Gender, and Marital Status
Text inputs for all other fields
Two-column layout for related fields on larger screens
Submit button with validation
Proper keyboard types (number for age/phone, email for email field)

Photo Upload Section:

Shows a placeholder icon for the photo
"Browse" button ready for file picker integration
Displays file size requirements
Shows "No file selected" status

The photo capture/upload functionality can be easily added later using packages like image_picker for both gallery and camera access. The form is fully functional with validation and a clean, professional appearance.
